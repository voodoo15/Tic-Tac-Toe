# Tic-Tac-Toe
Basic Tic Tac Toe game.  Set to portrait and no constraints on objects.  Set to iPhone 4.7" screen)

This is my Tic Tac Toe game demo app based on the Udemy online course that I'm currently taking.  I have it locked in 
portrait mode and is set to a 4.7" screen because I wanted to focus on the mechanics at the moment.  I will get back to
it and fix the constraits so it will work universally down the road.
